### SQL Query Explanation

```sql
SELECT BRAND, COUNT(*) AS Product_Count 
FROM PRODUCTS 
WHERE CATEGORY_1 = 'Snacks' 
  AND CATEGORY_2 = 'Dips & Salsa' 
  AND BRAND != '' 
  AND BRAND != 'PRIVATE LABEL' 
GROUP BY BRAND 
ORDER BY Product_Count DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Query Breakdown:

1. **SELECT BRAND, COUNT(*) AS Product_Count**: 
   - This part of the query selects the `BRAND` column from the `PRODUCTS` table and counts the number of products associated with each brand.
   - The `COUNT(*)` function counts the total number of rows (products) for each brand in the specified categories. The result is aliased as `Product_Count`.

2. **FROM PRODUCTS**: 
   - This specifies the `PRODUCTS` table as the main source of data for the query.

3. **WHERE CATEGORY_1 = 'Snacks' AND CATEGORY_2 = 'Dips & Salsa'**: 
   - This condition filters the rows to include only products that belong to both the **'Snacks'** category in `CATEGORY_1` and the **'Dips & Salsa'** category in `CATEGORY_2`.
   - It ensures that only products from the "Snacks" and "Dips & Salsa" categories are considered.

4. **AND BRAND != '' AND BRAND != 'PRIVATE LABEL'**: 
   - This filters out products where the `BRAND` is either an empty string (`''`) or labeled as 'PRIVATE LABEL'.
   - The condition ensures that only recognized brands (excluding empty or private label entries) are included in the count.

5. **GROUP BY BRAND**: 
   - This groups the rows by the `BRAND` column. 
   - This means that for each unique brand, the query will count how many products are associated with that brand in the specified categories.

6. **ORDER BY Product_Count DESC**: 
   - This orders the result by `Product_Count` in descending order, meaning the brand with the highest product count will appear first.

7. **LIMIT 1**: 
   - This limits the output to only the top resultâ€”the brand with the highest number of products in the 'Snacks' and 'Dips & Salsa' categories.

### Output Explanation:

The query will return the brand that has the most products in the **'Snacks'** and **'Dips & Salsa'** categories (excluding empty or private label brands). The result will show the **brand** name and the **product count**.

For example, if the output is:

```
BRAND, Product_Count
COCA-COLA, 50
```

- **COCA-COLA** is the leading brand with 50 products in the "Snacks" and "Dips & Salsa" categories.
- The **Product_Count** (50) represents the number of products under the **COCA-COLA** brand in these categories.

This query helps identify the most dominant brand in a specific product category combination, useful for analysis of brand presence or sales performance in particular product categories.
