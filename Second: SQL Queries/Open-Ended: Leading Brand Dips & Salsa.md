### SQL Query Explanation: Leading Brand in Dips & Salsa Category

The SQL query is designed to find the leading brand in the **Dips & Salsa** category, specifically under the **Snacks** category. It performs the following actions:

1. **Filters Data**:
   - The query restricts the data to only products in the **Snacks** category (`CATEGORY_1 = 'Snacks'`).
   - It also filters to include only products in the **Dips & Salsa** category (`CATEGORY_2 = 'Dips & Salsa'`).
   
2. **Excludes Invalid Data**:
   - It excludes any records where the **BRAND** is empty or labeled as **PRIVATE LABEL** (`BRAND != '' AND BRAND != 'PRIVATE LABEL'`), assuming that "PRIVATE LABEL" is not considered a brand.
   
3. **Groups and Counts**:
   - The query groups the products by the **BRAND** and counts the number of products per brand (`COUNT(*) AS Product_Count`).
   
4. **Orders the Results**:
   - The query orders the brands by the count of products, in descending order (`ORDER BY Product_Count DESC`).
   
5. **Returns the Leading Brand**:
   - Finally, it limits the result to just the top brand with the highest count (`LIMIT 1`).

### Result

Based on the query, **Sabra** emerges as the leading brand in the **Dips & Salsa** category, when considering valid brands and excluding private labels.
