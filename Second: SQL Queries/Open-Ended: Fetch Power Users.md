## SQL Query: Fetching Power Users and Explanation

### Query:
```sql
SELECT USER_ID, COUNT(RECEIPT_ID) AS Number_of_Transactions
FROM TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY USER_ID
ORDER BY Number_of_Transactions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **`SELECT USER_ID, COUNT(RECEIPT_ID) AS Number_of_Transactions`**:
   - This part selects two columns: 
     - `USER_ID`: The unique identifier for each user from the `TRANSACTIONS` table.
     - `COUNT(RECEIPT_ID) AS Number_of_Transactions`: This counts how many transactions (receipts) each user has made. We use `COUNT()` function to tally up the `RECEIPT_ID`s for each user and alias this as `Number_of_Transactions`.

2. **`FROM TRANSACTIONS`**:
   - Specifies that the data is being pulled from the `TRANSACTIONS` table, where all transaction records are stored.

3. **`GROUP BY USER_ID`**:
   - This groups the result by each `USER_ID`. Each group will represent a unique user, and for each user, the number of transactions (counted by `RECEIPT_ID`) will be calculated.

4. **`ORDER BY Number_of_Transactions DESC`**:
   - This orders the result in descending order based on the `Number_of_Transactions`, so that users with the most transactions appear first.

5. **`LIMIT 10`**:
   - This limits the result to the top 10 users, showing only the 10 users with the highest number of transactions.

### Output Explanation:

Here is an example of what the query returns:

```
USER_ID                                 | Number_of_Transactions
--------------------------------------------------------
64e62de5ca929250373e6cf5                | 22
62925c1be942f00613f7365e                | 20
604278958fe03212b47e657b                | 20
64063c8880552327897186a5                | 18
6327a07aca87b39d76e03864                | 14
624dca0770c07012cd5e6c03                | 14
61d5f5d2c4525a3a478b386b                | 14
60a5363facc00d347abadc8e                | 14
609af341659cf474018831fb                | 14
6682cbf6465f309038ae1888                | 12
```

### Explanation of the Output:

- **USER_ID**: This is the unique identifier for each user. In this case, each string like `64e62de5ca929250373e6cf5` represents a unique user.
  
- **Number_of_Transactions**: This shows how many transactions each user has made. For example:
  - `64e62de5ca929250373e6cf5` has made 22 transactions.
  - `62925c1be942f00613f7365e` and `604278958fe03212b47e657b` each made 20 transactions.
  - The user with `6682cbf6465f309038ae1888` made the fewest transactions in the top 10, with 12.

### Key Takeaways:

- The query helps identify **power users**, or the most active users, by counting their transactions.
- By sorting in descending order, the most active users are displayed at the top of the list.
- The output shows the `USER_ID` along with their respective **transaction count**, allowing for an analysis of the top users based on engagement.
